## Introduction

This repository provides a sample Flutter application showcasing an effective architecture that
promotes scalability, testability, and maintainability. The goal is to help developers understand
and implement robust architectural patterns in their Flutter projects.

## Features

- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- State management using GetX
- Dependency injection using GetX
- Repository pattern for data access
- Modular and scalable project structure

## Technologies Used

- Flutter
- Dart
- GetX (state management and dependency injection)
- Dio (networking)
- Flutter Material icons - Recommended

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version X.X.X or higher)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (version X.X.X or higher)

### Installation

- Install Flutter 3.22.3 or latest version
- Install **Melos** latest version (Optional)
- Install **fvm** latest version (Optional)

### Environment

- At Config module
- `cd configs`
- Generated: `dart run lib/src/env.json.dart create`
- Generated: `dart run lib/src/web.json.dart create`

### MacOs

- One time: `make denied` (Mac OS)
- PreBuild:
    - `make pre-bootstrap`
    - `make pub-get`
    - `make build-init`
    - `make build-runner`
- Run: `make run flavor=[dev|staging|prod]`

### Window

_If you can not install Melos, Fvm on Windown. You need to follow step by step to ready run source
code_

- **scripts package**
    - cd scripts
    - sh pre-bootstrap.sh
- flutter pub get
- **utilities package**:
    - cd utilities
    - flutter pub get
- **domain package**
    - cd domain
    - flutter pub get
    - flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
- **data package**
    - cd data
    - flutter pub get
    - flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
- **config package**
    - cd configs
    - flutter pub get
    - flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
- **app package**
    - cd app
    - flutter pub get
- Run source
    - cd configs
    - dart run lib/src/env.json.dart [dev|staging|prod]
    - cd ..
    - dart run scripts/build.dart [dev|staging|prod] -> Run complete and copy command on console
    - cd app
    - paste command and run

### WidgetBook

- Widget Book is a web platform to build UIkit. It runs quickly on web instead of run by the mobile
  platform.
- Run Project:
    - One time: `make denied` (Mac OS)
    - PreBuild:
        - `make pre-bootstrap`
        - `make pub-get`
        - `make build-init`
        - `make build-runner`
    - `make widget-book`
